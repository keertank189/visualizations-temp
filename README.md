# Visualization repository

This repository has been set up to showcase some of the visualization work that I have undertaken, either as part of my coursework or through personal projects. 

Of particular interest, the 'Time series.md' file contains some basic time series plots. 

The other .md files have used Python for their plots as well (Matplotlib/Seaborn).

The 'q1.html' has an interactive plot in part b of the file. 

The remaining files contain a large number and types of visualizations from various coursework/projects I have undertaken.
